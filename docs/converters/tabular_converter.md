# Tabular converter
Tabular data is commonly stored in spreadsheet files: Excel files, CSV files, GNF files, databases, pandas DataFrames, etc.
The similarity between all tabular data is that it contains multiple `tables`, each with multiple `columns`, possibly with a specific `unit` row.
Others may have categorical values that need to be further mapped (i.e., open: 0, closed: 1).
These attributes are referred to as `substitutions`.

## Mapping file
A mapping file is a yaml file with three main sections `grid`, `units` and `substitutions`:
```yaml
grid:

  Nodes:
    node:
      auto_id:
        key: Number
      u_rated: Unom
      extra: ID

  Cables:
    line:
      id:
        auto_id:
          key: Number
      from_node:
        auto_id:
          table: Nodes
          key:
            Number: From.Number      
      from_status: From.Switch state
      to_node:
        auto_id:
          table: Nodes
          key:
            Number: To.Number      
      to_status: To.Switch state

units:
  A:
  F:
    µF: 0.000001

substitutions:
  ".*Switch state":
    "off": 0
    "in": 1
    "on": 1
```

## Grid
For each `table`, the target PGM `component` is listed (e.g., Nodes: node, Cables: line).
The for each PGM `column` the source column is supplied (e.g., u_rated: Unom, from_status: From.SwitchStatus).

## Field Definitions
If the `column` definition is a one-on-one mapping, the value is simply the name of the source column (e.g., u_rated: Unom).
In many other cases, however, mappings can be a bit more complex.
You can use the following `column` definitions: 

  * Column name `str`
    ```yaml
    from_node: From.Number
    ```
  * First matching column name that exists in the data `str`
    ```yaml
    p_specified: Inverter.Pnom | Inverter.Snom
    ```
  * Automatic IDs `Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]` with single key `reference`, required attribute `key` and optinal 
    attributes `table` and `name`. More extensive examples are shown in the section [AutoID Mapping](##autois-mapping).
    ```yaml
    id:
      auto_id:
        key: Number
    ```
 
  * Reference to a column on another sheet `Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]` with single key `reference` and the 
    ```yaml
    r1:
      reference:
        query_column: Shortname
        other_table: Cable Properties
        key_column: Type short
        value_column: R
    ```
  * Constant value `int` or `float`
    ```yaml
    from_status: 1
    tan1: 0.0
    ```
  * Pandas DataFrame functions `Dict[str, List[Any]]`
    (`prod`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, etc. and the alias `multiply` which translates to `prod`)
    ```yaml
    p_specified:
      min:
        - Pnom
        - Inverter.Pnom
    ```
  * Custom functions `Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]`
    ```yaml
      g0:
        power_grid_model_io.functions.complex_inverse_real_part:
          real: R0
          imag: X0
    ```
  * Nested definitions:
    ```yaml
    q_specified:
      power_grid_model_io.functions.phase_to_phase.reactive_power:
        p:
          min:
            - Pnom
            - Inverter.Pnom | Inverter.Snom
        cos_phi: Inverter.cos phi
    ```
    Is similar to something like:
    ```python
    from power_grid_model_io.functions.phase_to_phase import reactive_power
    
    q_specified = reactive_power(
      p=min(
        table["Pnom"],
        table["Inverter.Pnom"] if "Inverter.Pnom" in table else table["Inverter.Snom"]
      ),
      cos_phi=1.0
    )
    ```
## Units
Power Grid Model uses SI units (e.g., "W" for Watts), but source data may be supplied in different units (e.g., "MW" for Mega Watts).
If units are supplied in the tabular data, the data stored using pandas DataFrame is expected to have `MultiIndexes` for columns.
For our application, a `MultiIndex` can be interpreted as a tuple; the first element is the column name, the second element is the column unit. For example: `("C0", "µF")`.

If an optional unit is supplied, it should be defined in the unit section of the mapping.
Undefined units that do not exist in mapping are not allowed.

```yaml
units:
  A:
  F:
    µF: 0.000001
  ohm/m:
    ohm/km: 0.001
```
The definitions above can be interpreted as:
  * **A** is a valid SI unit
  * **F** is a valid SI unit
    * 1 **µF** = 0.000001 **A**
  * **ohm/m** is a valid SI unit
    * 1 **ohm/km** = 0.001 **ohm/m**

## Substitutions
Some columns may contain categorical values (enums) that should be mapped. The column names can be defined as 
regular expressions. 
```yaml
substitutions:
  ".*Switch state":
    "off": 0
    "in": 1
    "on": 1
  N1:
    none: false
    own: true
```
The definitions above can be interpreted as:
  * In all columns that end with `SwitchState` (e.g., `From.Switch State`, `To.Switch State` or just `Switch State`),
    the word "off" should be replaced with integer value 0, and the word "in" integer value 1.
  * In all columns called "N1",
    the word "none" should be replaced with the boolean value `false`,
    and the word "own" boolean value `true`.

## AutoID
The `id` field is special in the sense that each object should have a unique numerical id in power grid model. 
Therefore, each id definition is mapped to a numerical (integer) ID.
Field names that end with `node` are also mapped to corresponding numerical IDs.

```python
from power_grid_model_io.utils.auto_id import AutoID

auto_id = AutoID()
a = auto_id("Alpha")   # a = 0
b = auto_id("Bravo")   # b = 1
c = auto_id("Alpha")   # c = 0 (because key "Alpha" already existed)
item = auto_id[1]      # item = "Bravo"
 ```
  
See also {py:class}`power_grid_model_io.utils.AutoID`

## AutoID Mapping
Let's consider a very common example of the usage of `auto_id` in a mapping file
(note that we're focussing on the ids and references, other attributes are therefore omitted).
```yaml
  Nodes:
    node:
      id:
        auto_id:
          key: Number
    Cables:
      line:
        id:
          auto_id:
            key: Number
        from_node:
          auto_id:
            table: Nodes
            key:
              Number: From_Number
        to_node:
          auto_id:
            table: Nodes
            key:
              Number: To_Number
```
This basically reads:
* For each row in the Nodes table, a PGM node instance is created.
  * For each node instance, a numerical id is generated, which is unique for each value in the Number column. This 
    assumes that the Number column is unique in the source table. Let's say tha values of the Number column in that 
    Nodes source table are `[101, 102, 103]`, then the generated IDs will be `[0, 1, 2]`. However, if the source 
    column is not unique, the pgm ids won't be unique as well: `[101, 102, 103, 101] -> [0, 1, 2, 0]`.
  * Under the hood, the table name `Nodes` and the column name `Number` are used to generate these IDs:
    * `{"table": "Nodes", "key" {"Number": 101} -> 0`
    * `{"table": "Nodes", "key" {"Number": 102} -> 1`
    * `{"table": "Nodes", "key" {"Number": 103} -> 2`
* For each row in the Cables table, a PGM line instance is created.
  * For each line instance, a numerical id is generated, just like for the nodes.
    Let's say there are two Cables `[201, 202]` and the corresponding lines will have IDs `[3, 4]`.  
    * `{"table": "Cables", "key" {"Number": 201} -> 3`
    * `{"table": "Cables", "key" {"Number": 202} -> 4`
  * A Cable connects to two Nodes.
    In this example Cable `201` connects Node `101` and `102`, and Cable `201` connects Node `102` and `103`.
    These Node Numbers are stored in the columns `From_Number` and `To_Number`.
    In order to retrieve the right PGM IDs, we have to explicitly state that the table in which the Nodes are 
    defined is called `Nodes` and the original column storing the Node Numbers is called `Number`.
  * On the 'from' side of the cables:
    * `{"table": "Nodes", "key" {"Number": 101} -> 0`
    * `{"table": "Nodes", "key" {"Number": 102} -> 1`
  * On the 'to' side of the cables:
    * `{"table": "Nodes", "key" {"Number": 102} -> 1`
    * `{"table": "Nodes", "key" {"Number": 103} -> 2`


## Advanced AutoID Mapping
In some cases, multiple components have to be created for each row in a source table.
In such cases, the `name` attribute may be necessary to create multiple PGM IDs for a single row. Consider
this example:
```yaml
  Transformer loads:
    transformer:
      id:
        auto_id:
          name: transformer
          key:
            - Node_Number
            - Subnumber
      from_node:
        auto_id:
          table: Nodes
          key:
            Number: Node_Number
      to_node:
        auto_id:
          name: internal_node
          key:
            - Node_Number
            - Subnumber
    node:
      id:
        auto_id:
          name: internal_node
          key:
            - Node_Number
            - Subnumber
    sym_load:
      id:
        auto_id:
          name: load
          key:
            - Node_Number
            - Subnumber
      node:
        auto_id:
          name: internal_node
          key:
            - Node_Number
            - Subnumber
```

Suppose we have one Transformer Load connected to the Node Number 103 and its Subnumber is 1.
Then the following IDs will be generated / retrieved:
* `transformer.id`:
  `{"table": "Transformer loads", "name": "transformer", "key" {"Node_Number": 103, "Subnumber": 1} -> 5`
* `transformer.from_node`:
  `{"table": "Nodes", "key" {"Number": 103} -> 2`
* `transformer.to_node`:
  `{"table": "Transformer loads", "name": "internal_node", "key" {"Node_Number": 103, "Subnumber": 1} -> 6`
* `node.id`:
  `{"table": "Transformer loads", "name": "internal_node", "key" {"Node_Number": 103, "Subnumber": 1} -> 6`
* `sym_load.id`:
  `{"table": "Transformer loads", "name": "load", "key" {"Node_Number": 103, "Subnumber": 1} -> 7`
* `sym_load.node`:
  `{"table": "Transformer loads", "name": "internal_node", "key" {"Node_Number": 103, "Subnumber": 1} -> 6`

## Secure Handling
Mapping files enable the specification of custom mappings or filter functions. These functions can come from the `power-grid-model-io` library, be user-provided, or even supplied by third parties. To ensure security, we implemented several measures. Best practices are recommended to prevent malicious code execution.
### Safe Loading of Configuration Files
We use the `yaml.safe_load` functionality from PyYAML library to load configuration files securely. This method prevents the execution of potentially malicious code during the loading process.
### Secure Function Handling
* No `eval`-like Functionality: 
  
  We do not use `eval` or similar functions that can execute arbitrary code.
* Loadable/Loaded Functions Only
  
  Only functions and symbols that are explicitly loadable or loaded are allowed. These must be:

  * Python Builtins: 
    
    Such as `max`.

  * Prefixed by Import Path: 
  
    Functions must include their relative or absolute import path, ensuring they are importable using `import_module`. For example, `numpy.max` is allowed, but `np.max` is not.
### Prevention of Malicious Code Injection
By enforcing the rules mentioned above, we prevent the inclusion of malicious code like:
```python
lambda x: return (malicious_code(), normal_code(x))[1]
```
In normal operation, this would be provided as normal_code, preventing harm from `malicious_code`.
### Best Practices for Production Environments
* File Permissions

  Configuration files should be treated similarly to Python source files, with appropriate file permissions.
* Controlled Access

  Only users or services with the correct privileges should be allowed to modify the configuration files.
